Emotion Recognition via Topological Data Analysis and Persistent Homology  

With the objective of emotion recognition, used topological data analysis tools of persistent homology to analyze features of facial frames' data. Calculated the distance matrix of the Wasserstein distances among the persistence diagrams for face frames' data.
